### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

None - This release is designed to be backward compatible with v0.x configurations. However, security features are now enabled by default, which may affect applications that rely on less secure defaults.

### üìà Migration Guide

#### From v0.x to v1.0.0

1. **Update package.json**

   ```json
   {
     "dependencies": {
       "stellar-js": "^1.0.0"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Review Security Configuration**

   - Security features are now enabled by default
   - Configure CORS explicitly for production
   - Set up audit logging if needed

3. **Update Server Configuration**

   ```typescript
   // Old (v0.x)
   const server = createServer({
     port: 3000,
     auth: { jwtSecret: 'secret' },
   });

   // New (v1.0.0) - Same code works, but with added security!
   const server = createServer({
     port: 3000,
     auth: { jwtSecret: 'secret' },
     // Optional: Customize security
     security: {
       /* ... */
     },
     cors: { origins: ['https://yourdomain.com'] },
   });
   ```

4. **Adopt New Validation** (Recommended)

   ```typescript
   // Replace custom validation with Joi schemas
   import { validate, Joi } from 'stellar-js';

   router.post('/user', validate(Joi.object({ email: Joi.string().email() })), handler);
   ```

### üéØ Roadmap for v1.1.0

- Database encryption at rest
- Advanced threat detection
- Redis-based rate limiting
- Distributed audit logging
- OAuth2 support
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- WebSocket security
- GraphQL security middleware
